# DLR

DLR is a stand-alone, light-weight and portable runtime for CNN and decicion-tree models. Built on top of [TVM](https://tvm.ai/) and [Treelite](https://treelite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) runtime, DLR provides simple and unified Python/C++ APIs for loading and running TVM/Treelite compiled models on a wide range of devices, including X86, TRT-enabled GPU and Arm devices.
